ABOUT THIS:

The _assets folder is a repository for all CSS, Javascript, and Flash as well as all 
images used in the sites CSS. Any fonts being used should be stored in the 
/_assets/_css/_fonts folder.  The CSS folder also contains an optional folder for 
.less files. 

If you wish to use Less to prepocess your CSS, the Less App can be found here: 
http://incident57.com/less/.  Please refrain from compiling Less server side.

Files related to the associated CMS are (or should be) stored in a sub folder 
called "app".


ABOUT SOME OF THE FILES:

global.css		This file is for all global styles.  Set your font-family here, 
				your headers, your paragraphs, everything global.  I know it's
				kind of self explanitory...
				
screen.less		This is your bread and butter.  It'll inport you colors file, as well
				as your mixins, which is explained later.
	
	
mixins.less		This Less file is for setting your mixins
				(http://lesscss.org/#-mixins).  Here's example of how to add 5px
				rounded corners mixin on the footer selector:
				
				footer{
					.rounded(5px)
				}
				
				The defaults are set at the mixin section.  Feel free to resent the
				defaults to your hearts content.
				
				
colors.less		I've set a few sample color variables in this file.  When you
				get a PSD, make sure to get the hex values for any important colors
				in your site.  Set these colors in the Brands sub section.  For instance
				if the site your working on has a brand with a specific red, set the 
				variable as @brandRed: #ff1e00;.
				
				
iOS				I've dropped some media queries for iOS devices in here.  Feel free to adjust
				to suit your needs (iPad, iPhone, ect...).
